# Loved by game devs   & studios

- Bezi is a dream come true. It's an invaluable part of my game dev toolbox - you can consider me a subscriber from now on.

Klas Holmlund









Creative Director

- Bezi is now the replacement for ChatGPT for game dev. I now exclusively use Bezi for questions about my projects, questions about different options for how to implement a feature, or debugging difficult bugs.

Nick Swift









SCH Games

- Bezi is truly, truly incredible. It has truly saved me a bunch of time and has helped me through the creation of some systems that I could have built myself, just not this fast.













![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/fTTPc8SxswESEhxC4ZOKjGt17JU.jpeg?width=450&height=450)







Leonardo de Andrade









Lazy Lion Games

- So impressed with Bezi. I gave it a pretty complex issue to analyze (a multiplayer card game where cards are getting out-of-sync between players) and it methodically and thoroughly analyzed my project hierarchy and code to give some potential causes and solutions.













![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/JwsVtyGZ6bHfO52hqQa8Hg15c.jpeg?width=690&height=690)







Greg Bradburn









Midnite Oil

- There was actually a bug in my game that I couldn't figure out for weeks on end, so I asked Bezi about it and it was able to solve my issue in about 5 minutes lol













![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/lCu31wtxmHbaE3v9mbq3AfHziU.jpg?width=400&height=400)







Nick De Paul









Wolf Soft Studios

- If you're working with Unity, and you want to try out some next level AI assistants to get you moving, I definitely recommend Bezi. It’s not offering generic solutions to generic problems, it’s understanding your current implementation and augmenting it, or improving it.













![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/ElYKwpsW529dxxjVUk0DKiRa2E.jpg?width=200&height=200)







Graham Weldon









Game Developer

- I recently got Bezi, and I found this tool extremely helpful. Bezi helps me integrate a quantity of disciplines that could hardly be possible without AI, and it’s helping me create a pretty unique narrative procedural engine, even creating modules! I now produce 6x faster modules with this app. This tool is literally changing the way I develop in Unity.













![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/OO1qxxIkSYqrh5LgBnjxR9W03Js.jpg?width=800&height=800)







Elrik Miralda









Game Developer

- YOOOOOO, just passing by to say the new Agent mode is so good it almost made me cry! Been creating tools for Unity games for so long (10+ years) and under 30 minutes got a very complex tool to manage my game events so much more complete and useful than I would have done myself! Keep the good work folks, love this tool so much!

Vinícius Pereira









Epic Games

- Bezi is my most commonly used tool and a big unlock for indie teams. It’s saved us weeks of debugging work so now we can actually focus on building our game. I can’t imagine building without it now.

Michael Leone









Systems Heavy

- Bezi is now walking me through my game in Unity. I was trying to do the same thing with ChatGPT and Claude, but Bezi got me to my end goal 10x faster.













![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/afxKkdrDnJPiZIwoxnfbCNobE.jpg?width=400&height=400)







Nick Romanek









AirPro Diagnostics

- Bezi is truly a game changer for designers like me who want to develop independently in Unity without needing extensive coding knowledge or relying on others. It works like an AI assistant for your Unity projects, helping streamline development, referencing elements directly from your hierarchy, and providing script suggestions that are easy to implement, all while offering guidance and helpful tips.













![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/rZE6XGIgU6i2tJgAjpAn6YJELg.jpg?width=200&height=200)







Anita Ghaffarian









XR Designer

- There have been significant leaps with AI assistance for game development: the 1st was the introduction of AI itself, the 2nd giving AI ability to think/reason before responding, and now Bezi. When I was using ChatGPT I had to keep refeeding it my code piecemeal and had to properly explain each part or what other assets or codes it may have to reference, but with Bezi it can consume the whole meal.

Danesvar Neelamagam









RoundBox Games

- Shout-out to Bezi for speeding up my early iteration and framing C# development (player controllers, game manager, etc).

Mondae A.









Leap of Faith Studios

- Over the past couple of months I've been trying out Bezi, and it's a very useful tool. The team has made so many usability improvements since I've been using it that it's actually insane.

AIA









Game Dev Youtuber

- I’m genuinely impressed. Bezi integrates seamlessly into the Unity Editor and acts like a context-aware co-pilot, helping you debug issues, optimize performance, and accelerate development with real-time, AI-guided insights. From spotting null references to suggesting smart scene optimizations, it's like pair programming with a tireless, laser-focused dev buddy.

Yousuf Jawad

- Finally had the time to test Bezi fully and it’s a game changer. Massive increase in workflow productivity!

Reegan Naidoo









Gamebok

- Bezi enables me to create more powerful Unity tooling faster than I've been able to do manually, and in some cases, the systems enabled systems that I didn't even know existed. The ability to recognize project specific settings, errors, and multiple classes at once makes Bezi smarter, and easier to work with for usable results.

Andrew Slater









Unity Technologies

- Y'all are geniuses. Agent mode is the best. The AI giving clear instructions, being able to "@" references, giving code with tool tips and useful public inspector tweakable fields. Perfection.

Brandon Whitman









Game Developer

- After just 10 days of using Bezi, I have accomplished more than I did in months. With speed, accuracy, and access to complete code structures in minutes, the only bottleneck now is art. I am amazed how quickly I’ve been knocking out systems and can focus on the things I enjoy!

Stephen Clarke









Tesla

- Bezi is a big win for small teams. It makes designing complex mechanics such as 2D RTS pathfinding and a fog of war system a breeze. Outperforms other coding assistants in understanding of both Unity and the needs and structure of my projects.
